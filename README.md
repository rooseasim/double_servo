# double_servo
 Dual Servo Motor Control with Arduino  This Arduino project demonstrates how to control **two servo motors** using the `Servo.h` library. The servos are connected to digital pins 8 and 9 of the Arduino and sweep between 0°, 90°, and 180° repeatedly with a 1-second delay between each position.
